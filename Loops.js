for loop:

javascript
Copy code
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
while loop:

javascript
Copy code
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
do-while loop:

javascript
Copy code
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Higher-Order Array Methods:
forEach:

javascript
Copy code
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.forEach(function (number) {
  console.log(number);
});
// Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
map:

javascript
Copy code
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function (number) {
  return number * 2;
});
console.log(doubledNumbers);
// Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
filter:

javascript
Copy code
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function (number) {
  return number % 2 === 0;
});
console.log(evenNumbers);
// Output: [2, 4]
reduce:

javascript
Copy code
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce(function (accumulator, number) {
  return accumulator + number;
}, 0);
console.log(sum);
// Output: 15
Considerations:
forEach: Used for iterating over array elements. It doesn't create a new array and is useful for performing an action on each element.

map: Creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array. Useful for transforming data.

filter: Creates a new array containing elements that satisfy a condition. Useful for extracting a subset of data.

reduce: Accumulates a single result by applying a function to each element. Useful for calculating a summary or a single value.

for loop: Traditional loops are more versatile and can be used for various types of iterations, including iterating over specific ranges.

while and do-while loops: Useful when you don't know the exact number of iterations beforehand, or when the loop should continue until a certain condition is met.

Each method or loop has its strengths and use cases, and the choice depends on the specific task you are trying to accomplish.
JavaScript conditions, specifically the if and else statements, 
allow you to control the flow of your program based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false.
 The basic syntax for an if statement is as follows:

javascript
Copy code
if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}
Here's a detailed breakdown of the if and else statements:

if Statement:
The if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition evaluates to true.
If the condition is false, the block of code inside the if statement is skipped.

javascript
Copy code
var age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
}
In this example, the code inside the if statement will be executed because the age is greater than or equal to 18.

else Statement:
The else statement is used to specify a block of code that should be executed 
if the condition in the preceding if statement is false. It provides an alternative 
code path when the initial condition is not met.

javascript
Copy code
var hour = 15;

if (hour < 12) {
  console.log("Good morning!");
} else {
  console.log("Good afternoon!");
}
In this example, if the hour is less than 12, the code inside the first block (after if) will be executed. Otherwise, the code inside the else block will be executed.

else if Statement:
You can extend the if-else structure by using the else if statement to check multiple conditions sequentially. Each else if statement is evaluated only if the previous conditions were false.

javascript
Copy code
var grade = 75;

if (grade >= 90) {
  console.log("A");
} else if (grade >= 80) {
  console.log("B");
} else if (grade >= 70) {
  console.log("C");
} else {
  console.log("D");
}
In this example, the program checks the value of grade against multiple conditions and prints the corresponding letter grade.

Nesting if Statements:
if statements can be nested inside each other to create more complex decision-making structures.

javascript
Copy code
var x = 10;

if (x > 0) {
  if (x < 5) {
    console.log("x is between 0 and 5");
  } else {
    console.log("x is greater than or equal to 5");
  }
} else {
  console.log("x is less than or equal to 0");
}
Here, the code checks if x is greater than 0, and if so, it checks whether it's less than 5 or greater than or equal to 5.

Understanding and using if and else statements is fundamental for creating decision-making logic in JavaScript programs. They provide the ability to execute different blocks of code based on the evaluation of conditions.

Variables are named containers used to store data values in programming. 
They act as symbolic names for values that can be used and manipulated in a program.
 When you create a variable, you're essentially setting aside a piece of memory to store a specific type of data,
 and you can later reference or modify that data using the variable name.

In JavaScript, there are several ways to declare variables, and each has some differences in terms of scope, hoisting
, and the way they handle assignments and reassignments. Here are the main ways to declare variables in JavaScript:

1. var (Function Scoped):
javascript
var x = 10;
Scope: Function-scoped, meaning the variable is only accessible within the function where it is declared.
Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope.
 This means you can use the variable before it's declared in the code.
Reassignment: You can reassign values to variables declared with var.
2. let (Block Scoped):

javascript

let y = 20;
Scope: Block-scoped, meaning the variable is only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) where it is declared.
Hoisting: Variables declared with let are also hoisted, but there is a "temporal dead zone" 
where accessing the variable before its declaration results in an error.
Reassignment: You can reassign values to variables declared with let.

3. const (Block Scoped, Immutable):
javascript

const z = 30;

Scope: Block-scoped, just like let.
Hoisting: Variables declared with const are hoisted, but like let, they are also in the temporal dead zone.
Reassignment: Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned once a value is assigned to them. However, 
if the value is an object or array, the properties or elements of the object or array can be modified.

javascript
const pi = 3.14;
pi = 3.14159;  This will throw an error because you can't reassign a const variable.

const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
person.age = 31;  This is allowed, as it's modifying the content, not reassigning the variable.
In summary, var is function-scoped and has some quirks due to hoisting, let is block-scoped and allows for variable reassignment,
 and const is also block-scoped but prevents variable reassignment after the initial assignment. 
 Choosing the appropriate type depends on your specific use case and the scope of the variable in your code. 
In modern JavaScript, it's common to use let and const more frequently than var.
